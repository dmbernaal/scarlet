#### Approach:
For this approach we will use ```clairvoyance``` training method. This include using an Auto-Encoder and FFN Ensemble. The Auto-encoder will perform feature extraction and will serve as a *data augmentation* method on our raw-continuous data. 

The FFN will be a basic FFN - Ranger Optimization, SeLU activation, and linear training method. We will also use a Flattened Label Smoothing Cross Entropy.

#### Results: 
```99.3%``` Accuracy: **Clairvoyance Training**
```98%``` Acuracy: *Baseline Model*
